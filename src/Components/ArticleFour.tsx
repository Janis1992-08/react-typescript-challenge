                <h2>Season 5 Review</h2>
                <p>Season 5 of Rick and Morty has been a wild ride. Here's our review of the latest season:</p>
                <p>The season kicks off with some high-concept sci-fi episodes that push the boundaries of what the show
                    can do. Highlights include the episode where Rick and Morty encounter decoy families and the
                    mind-bending adventures with alternate realities. However, some fans felt that the season's humor
                    was a bit hit-or-miss compared to previous seasons. Overall, Season 5 is a solid addition to the
                    series with plenty of memorable moments.</p>
